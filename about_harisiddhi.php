According to the Hindu Econography goddess Harsiddhi has 4 hands with Damaru, Kamandalu, Khadga and Kalash. The origin of this goddess is Ujjain India.</p>

		<h3>Arrival of Harsiddhi Goddess</h3>
		<div class="acc-section">
			<div class="acc-content">
				<p>The origin of Harisiddhi is in India. Indian emperor Bikramaditya is the founder of "Bikram Sambat" who came to Nepal and brought his beloved goddess Harisiddhi and establish in Baneshwor, Nepal. He started the dance of god and goddess. After some year, the dance is discontinued. At the Lichhabi dynasty 745 B.S., Goddess Harisiddhi is transferred to Harsiddhi village and started the dance. Again the dance is discontinued for some years. At the time of Amar Malla, the famous incantatory Gayojuju brought the disappeared dance and Yog Narendra Malla provided 310 ropanies land for the purpose of daily worship and 294 ropanies land to continue the dance.</p><p>
In the middle of the village, the temple of goddess Harsiddhi is established. Instead of the recognition of "Bhairab, Harsiddhi and Kumari" three clay-pot with full of water are set in the temple towards west direction. This goddess is also known as Tri-Shakti, Tri-Devi, Maheswori, Amba Maa, Baishnavi and Jagdambba.</p><p>
According to the main priest Tri-Bikram Jwalananda Rajopadhya, main goddess Harsiddhi is the creator of the world. She creates "Bhairab and Kumari" with her miracle power. So, she is also known as Tri-Shakti (three powered) goddess. 
According to Devi Puran (history) era 75 page no. 18, though goddess is imageless still with her miracle power, possess image and believed that she accept the public-pray if prayed with holy-mind and blesses the prayer according to their wish.</p>

					  	 <p>According to the history of Nepal, the mask dance of goddess Harsiddhi is the "First Mask Dance" of Nepal. It is well known that there is no vocal and instrumental music and dramatic performance equal to that of Harsiddhi. The dance is very fantastic still. One can not satisfied with his first seen.</p><p>
The combination of music with different instruments and the vocal which is believed the original voice of the god at that time is very charming.</p><p>
In the old days, this dance is performed three months continuously. The people were not interested to watch such a long period dance and the value of it was going decreasing. So that the dance is completed within a day accumulating the main events of the dance. So, it is a little difficult to understand the nature of dance in a day, said the priest. No argument that the dance is very exciting.
Now-a-days, the dance is performed two times in a year. First is at the time of "Yomari Purnima" and the 2nd is at "Holy Purnima". This time is the main festival of the local people and their closer friends and relatives are invited as guest.

						<h3>Arrival of Harsiddhi from Phulchoki forest<a href="#"></a></h3>
						<div class="acc-section">
							<div class="acc-content">
								<p>During the mall dynasty, there lived a famous incantatory named Gayojuju (Yogendranand Rajopadhya), he could talk with god and goddess and able to get up the death body. He had started Gurukul School in his home. His pupils helped him in household as well as learning.</p><p>
One day one of his pupils went to Godawari forest to collect some wood. He heard there a strange musical sound. He went ahead listening that sound. He reached the top of the Phulchoki forest and saw the strange scene. He was afraid and had gone to hide in a bush from there, he looked those strange scene that god and goddess came down from the heaven, performed dance with lovely music and departured. The events were continued for a day long. In the evening the dance was ended. He came from the bush and forgot that he was coming to collect the wood. He came back with empty hand. When guru asked him about the empty hand, he explained the description of events he had seen in the forest. The guru was also very surprised about that. The guru was curious to know about the events. Next morning the guru with his pupils went to the venue with full preparation. They looked all circumstances hiding in a bush. The guru banned the area by raw string with incantation.</p><p>
God and goddess came down to dance from heaven. But they could not departure. All of them came down and dance but no one could departure. Then goddess Harsiddhi asked who did that? Soon, Guru came out from the bush and apologizes in front of the Harsiddhi and he did so because he was not satisfied yet to watch the dance. So, he prayed to get chance to watch the dance again.
The goddess said that the management is difficult to perform that dance. When the guru promised to managed the required materials Devi agreed the promise.</p><p>
The guru chantedly makes the gods to enter in drinking vessel, wraps the vessel with raw string and covered with grass. They came down from the hill carrying the vessel by a pupil. When they reached at the 9 taps (Nau Dhara â€“ place name), bottom of the hill they liked to have a rest. When they reached at Thaiba (place name), they took rest and heard pig crying. Then Devi asked to departure from that place and taken near Harsiddhi village place called Sichako (place name) from that the travel continued to Harsiddhi village place called Niba (place name of Harsiddhi), ahead of 100 steps from that place Devi was established. Later the temple for Harsiddhi goddess is founded there.</p>

		<h3>12 years festival of Harsiddhi</h3>
		<div class="acc-section">
			<div class="acc-content">
				<p>The main functions of the 12 year tradition are as follows:-</p>
<ul class="listStyle">
  <li>Appointment of Priests</li>
  <li>Coloring of Masks</li>
  <li>Dress Making</li>
  <li>Bringing of Holy-Wood</li>
  <li>Re-gain the divine power</li>
  <li>The establishment of Kalash (Clay-vessel with full of water)</li>
</ul>

<p>The detail explanation of those functions is as follows:</p>


<ul class="acc" id="nested">
					<li>
					  <h3>Appointment of Priests<a href="#"></a></h3>
					  <div class="acc-section">
					    <div class="acc-content">
					  	 <p>Priests are appointed only in 12 years festival instead of death and disabled. Main priests 10 persons are appointed by the patron of the country (President). The elder son of the priest is chosen president wraps their head with the white piece of clothes for next 12 years as managers. In this 12 year festival 2066 B.S., President Ram Baran Yadev inaugurated the function. Before this time, His Majesty did it.</p><p>
	Other assistant priests are appointed by main priests consulting with the Brahman. Among main God and Goddess Kumari is appointed from main priest and Ganesh, Maheswori and Bhairab are from assistant priests.</p><p>
Angels among those 19 assistant priests, one boy is appointed who is not done Brata-Bandha(religious act) should not be dropped original teeth and no any other black spots on the body. In the same way other boy is appointed from the public. Those two boys are known as Jichamacha and Khola-Macha. It is believed that those boys are holy-person and used to clean and worship the god. And provide a little land for living.</p><p>
Unluckily, in the 12 year tradition of 2018 BS, court of the country decide that the priest who have learnt the voice of god should not be rejected so that those two boys are appointed only from the family of assistant priests.</p><p>
Miss-understanding this process, neighbor villagers and surrounded public believe that a human-being is sacrificed in Harisiddhi in every 12 year tradition, which is totally wrong. It is true that 5 animals (he-buffalo, sheep, goat, duck and a pair of fish) are sacrificed and blood is drunk to main goddess Maheswori, Kumari and the god Bhairab.</p><p>
The performance of Harsiddhi mask dance is difficult as well as expensive. So, a lot of land, nearly 600 ropanies of land are provided for the priests and other helpers, Other helpers are : a) potter(to make clay vessel), b) dress-maker, c)artists(to color the masks), d) music player as Sahanai (small clarinet), kaha (long clarinet), flower provider and so on.</p><p>
After the completion of fulfillment of priests Khola-Macha (angel) opens right side door of the temple which was shut on the day of cow festival and 4 days later Jichamacha (angel) opens left side door and enter all priests into the temple.</p><p>
Then, the dancing and musical training starts for them all under the rules and regulations of the temple.</p><p>
It is remind able that those priests wear traditional white dresses, and keep their hair long. They are not allowed to cut the hair, eat chicken, garlic and do smoking.</p><p>
On the occasion of function they put on strange cap (like a hat rounded by a long piece of cloth) and they are free from mourning culture. All they are respected in the village as well as neighboring villages. They themselves respect on the basis of their role in mask dance.</p><p>
Two week later of training, they rehearsal the dance in front of the temple without possessing mask and holy-dress. They only cover their face with bunch of flowers to avoid shame if done mistake on dancing.</p><p>
Some days later, villagers and VDC contribute some money to meet the requirement of expense to perform the full phase of mask dance. This festival is known as 12 year tradition of Harisiddhi and celebrates joyfully inviting their relatives from other places.

						<h3>Coloring of masks <a href="#"></a></h3>
						<div class="acc-section">
							<div class="acc-content">
								<p>Special painter is admitted to paint or color the mask so as to keep the mask in original color. This is possible only in 12 year tradition. In turn they are provided some plot of land as remuneration. They keep secret the method of coloring. And it is believed that the real image of the mask itself has divine power. They should not be look with empty hand.</p><p>
They paint the god of music "Nateswor" or Nriteswore or Nasa Dyo on a sheet of cloth, drawing three different eyes denoting Ganesh, mother (shy nature) and father (angry nature).</p><p>
The priests have to take fasting on the re-new establishment of Nasao Dyo and in the evening they go to bring the colored masks inside the temple.

						<h3>Dress making<a href="#"></a></h3>

                    <li>
						<h3>Bringing of holy wood <a href="#"></a></h3>
						<div class="acc-section">
							<div class="acc-content">
								A kind of wood which is needed to burn while chanting by a guru to make pure the condition is brought from the Phulchoki forest in the former. But now a days it is brought from the small bush where available nearby the village by guru in especial manner and carried it to the place where mask dance is performed. During this time, they are welcomed by guru in south gate entrance.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Regain the divine power <a href="#"></a></h3>
						<div class="acc-section">
							<div class="acc-content">
								<p>It is believed that the divine power of god and goddess are diminished at the end of every 12 year. So, they have to re-gain the divine power. They go to the following places of Kathmandu valley for pray to re-gain the divine power as:</p>
<ul class="listStyle">
  <li>Sunakothi</li>
  <li>Chobhar Ganesh</li>
  <li>Jalandhar, Kirtipur</li>
  <li>Balkhu Bishnu Devi, Naikap</li>
  <li>Sita Paila, Kathmandu</li>
  <li>Mhepi, Naya bazaar</li>
  <li>Old Baneshwor</li>
  <li>Dadhikot, Bhaktapur</li>
  <li>Okhata Sanagaon, Lalitpur</li>
  <li>Harisiddhi Pith, Lalitpur</li>
  <li>Nasao Dyo and, Lalitpur</li>
  <li>Harisiddhi Temple</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those 29 priests go to the place. One by one and main god and goddess who are covered with a big piece of clothe separately are Ganesh, Maheswori, Bhairab and Kumari. They sit in front of the concerned deity. Other priests who take part in music will spell the divine words. In some minute they trembled themselves which is the symbol of re-gained power. Normal person cannot tremble continuously for a long time as they do.</p><p>
They chant, sitting in front of those deities. They will not communicate by words with the public. If they need something they indicate with hands or write on a sheet of paper. Knowing this situation the local government VDC requested the LDO/CDO to help for the police to escort. Because they have to reach all those place in a day. It is possible only if there is no traffic jam. In the former it took long days. They had to carry required things. There were no transportation facilities. They were always busy. They could not participate in the work of private interest. They should not be touched by man and animals to regain the power. In the former, while they walk on the way, general people did not understand. If some obstacle found on their walking, they ex-hole the voice to be aside. When the priests wear their formal dress, they appear strange and the general people may afraid or may attack. They may think that those are miss-kind people. But it is miss-understanding only.
